    "Looks like NOAA already has some good quality control, but what about those `-9999`s? If we keep them in, they'll mess up any calculations or visualizations we make. Let's take a look at what we mean by creating a <a href=\"https://plotly.com/python/histograms/\">histogram</a>. Histograms are useful because it allows us to see the distribution of our dataset. It can answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* What is the range (the minimum and the maximum)?\n",
    "* What is the spread?\n",
    " * Is it evenly distributed across the range or are certain values more common than others?\n",
